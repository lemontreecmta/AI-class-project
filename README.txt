My code for projects in Artificial Intelligence CS 356 - Spring 2015. 

Projects include:

1. Differentiation with LISP (in /differentiation/)

2. Search for solutions of 8-puzzle using BFS, DFS and iterative deepening (in /8-puzzle/)

3. Feed-forward neural network construction using LISP (in /neural-net-lisp/)

4. Use genetic algorithms to minimize sinbowl functions (in /genetic-algorithms/)
